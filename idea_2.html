    <p class="bio">I was born and grew up in Mobile, AL (a former French colony and the first capital of Louisiana prior to its purchase).
        I attended the University of South Alabama where I double-majored in Studio Art and French. In 2012, I was fortunate to study abroad and attended Universit√© Paul Valerie in Montpellier, France.
        After graduating, I was accepted into the TAPIF program and returned to France as a teaching assistant. After finishing the program, I returned to the US and found my way to the SF Bay Area where I have happily lived ever since.

    <p class="experience">I probably don't really need an experience page. I should probably just put my resume next to my Bio. Maybe I can use this for something else.</p>
