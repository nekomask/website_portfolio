My Portfolio Website

Brandon Kiefer


This is definitely an alpha version for my future website. I expect it will probably look nothing like this by the time I finish my coding bootcamp.

Every page can be viewed in English or French dictated by the 2 links on the upper right part of the header.

There are 5 total pages:

1. The Home page- welcomes the viewer to my page.
It's pretty basic right now. I could add another image to the background to make it seem a little more dynamic and interesting but this will do for now.

2. Bio- this is a short summary of my academic background.
By far the most interesting thing on this page (and probably the whole website) is actually a clippy-inspired version of my old dog Rufus.
He pops up and asks if you need any help browsing the website and when you click on him he remembers that he is just a dog and wishes you all the best.

The animation isn't perfect with every resolution but he should at least be peering over the footer to some degree. I turned off the scroll bar in CSS because I thought it looked cheap everytime he was popping up- and now it looks a lot more seamless. I also changed the cursor in CSS when you hover over him to let the viewer know that he is a clickable element. The only attribute I animated for Rufus's chat bubble was the opacity because I could not get it to move from an X or Y direction without it snapping into some other position when the animation was completed (especially with the resolution variable always changing but I tried for a long time to get it to work). 

View this page in French for something extra!

3. Projects- just a small image gallery of my terminal games for now.

4. Experience- this page contains a link to my resume in PDF format. This page is pretty basic for now.
I could probably include a few snippets of my previous work on this page in a future version but I'm actually not quite sure any of my previous experience is super relevant anyway.

5. Skills- this lists what I believe to be my 5 most desireable current skills to get a coding position.
When you click on each skill it will display a short description about why I think they're important.

In addition to these pages, there is a fixed footer that contains links to my LinkedIn and Github along with my email address contact information.
