My Portfolio Website

Brandon Kiefer

This is definitely an alpha version for my future website. I expect it may look nothing like this by the time I finish my coding bootcamp.

Every page can be viewed in English or French dictated by the 2 links on the upper right part of the header.

There are 5 total pages:

1. The Home page- welcomes the viewer to my page.
It's pretty basic right now. I could add another image to the background to make it seem a little more dynamic and interesting but this will do for now.

2. Bio- this is a short summary of my academic background.
By far the most interesting thing on this page (and probably the whole website) is actually a clippy-inspired version of my old dog Rufus.
He pops up and asks if you need any help browsing the website and when you click on him he remembers that he is just a dog and wishes you all the best.
View this page in French for something extra!

3. Projects- just a small image gallery of my terminal games for now.

4. Experience- this page contains a link to my resume in PDF format. This page is pretty basic for now.
I could probably include a few snippets of my previous work on this page in a future version but I'm actually not quite sure any of my previous experience is super relevant anyway.

5. Skills- this lists what I believe to be my 5 most current skills to get a coding position.
When you click on the skills it will display a short description about why they're listed.

In addition to these pages, there is a fixed footer that contains links to my LinkedIn and Github along with my email address which I did not make clickable because I hate when microsoft office tries to pop-up.

Thank you for visiting my website!
